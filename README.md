# Welcome!

My name is Alexander Abreu and this is my portfolio website for my work 
as a technical writer and documentation manager.

So if you're hiring or curious about the work of one San Francisco-based documentarian, 
have a look around!

I'm using (for now...) GitHub Pages and Jekyll for styling. 


# What's on here?

This is the landing page for my porfolio website on GitHub. 
Around the rest of the site you'll find:

## How I approach documentation

In my lengthening career I've done every kind of tech writing, 
from spiral-bound binders for manual procedures, 
to wikis for software and internet applications.

I'm a humanities major who operates well in a STEM environment
and there are lessons I take from that experience
which may be [interesting to other writers]() or others 
that may be [curious to hire]() one for the first time.
