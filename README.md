# Welcome!

My name is Alexander Abreu and this is my portfolio website for my work 
as a technical writer and documentation manager.

So if you're hiring or curious about the work of one San Francisco-based documentarian, 
have a look around!

I'm using (for now...) GitHub Pages and Jekyll for styling. 


# What's here?

This is the landing page for my porfolio website on GitHub.

## How I approach docs

In my lengthening career I've done every kind of tech writing, 
from spiral-bound binders for manual procedures, 
to wikis for software and internet applications.

I'm a humanities major who operates well in a STEM environment.
On a job, I'll often make a little corner on a wiki where
clients can not only request support, but also get an idea
for what tech writers do and how they do it.

Curious to hire a writer? Here's some insight into what we do:
